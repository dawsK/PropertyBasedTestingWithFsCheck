# Testing #

' Property-based testing asserts that the characteristics, traits, or attributes of some code always
' holds true, rather than just in example scenarios. It uses randomly generated input data to create
' deterministic automated tests.
' 
' It might be helpful to constrast this with what we are more familiar with, example-based testing.
' Let's consider an example...

Did you put the <span class="accentYellow">yellow</span> car in the <span class="accent">cupboard?</span>
<br />

---

Did you hang the <span class="accent">Spiderman</span> costume that was on the floor by the couch, back on the wall on the 
<span class="accentYellow">third</span> hook?

--- 

Did you <span class="accent">pick up</span> the brown LEGO piece by the <span class="accent">table</span> and put it in the lego box?

#### Example with ####
# Modulo

' Suppose we would like to implement the modulo operation
' How would we go about testing it?

---    

## Example-based testing ##

    open Xunit
    open FsUnit.Xunit
    
    [<Fact>]
    let ``10 % 5 should equal 0`` () =
        modulo 10 5 |> should equal 0
---

    let modulo m n = 0

---
    
    [<Fact>]
    let ``20 % 3 should equal 2`` () =
        modulo 20 3 |> should equal 2
        
---

    let modulo m n = 
        match (m, n) with
        | (20, 3) -> 2
        | (_, _) -> 0
        
---
        
    [<Fact>]
    let ``3453234 % 32 should equal 18`` () =
        modulo 3453234 32 |> should equal 18

--- 

    let modulo m n = 
        match (m, n) with
        | (20, 3) -> 2
        | (3453234, 32) -> 18
        | (_, _) -> 0

## How to find properties ##

' Scott Wlaschin
' Choosing properties for property-based testing

---

### Different paths
## <span class="accentYellow">same destination</span>

<i class="fa fa-code-fork fa-5x"></i>

' add 1, add 2 same as add 2, add 1

---

### <span class="accentYellow">There and back again</span>

<i class="fa fa-exchange fa-5x"></i>

' serialization/deserialization

---

### Some things <span class="accentYellow">never</span> change

<i class="fa fa-exchange fa-5x"></i>

' invariants, like ordering of a sorted list

---

The more things change, the more they stay the same
##<span class="accentYellow">Idempotence</span>

' doing an operation twice results in the same state
' distinct, twice

---

<span class="larger">Solve a <span class="altHeader">smaller</span> problem <span class="accentYellow">first</span></span>
<br/><br/>
<i class="fa fa-scissors fa-5x"></i>

' structural induction. If a property holds true for a small partitition, it should be true for a large thing as well

---

### Hard to prove
## <span class="accentYellow">easy to verify</span>

<i class="fa fa-check-circle-o fa-5x"></i>

' NP-complete problems, like the knapsack problem
' path through a maze

---

### The test <span class="altHeader larger">oracle</span>
<br/>
<i class="fa fa-magic fa-5x"></i>

' comparing algorithm against refactored or improved algorithm

## When to Use Property-based Testing ##

---

- Functions
- Lots of possible inputs
- Not for integration/slow tests


' Functions with an easily defined input and output
' If the input space and output space is small, example based testing is fine, just write tests for every scenario
' Don't use them for integration style tests, or any test that is inherently slow. You will be calling your code lots of times
